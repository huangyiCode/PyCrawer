The opening function:
    if __name__ =='__main__'
        ...

The import way:
    1.import *
    2.import * as [alias]
    3.from * import (*Sub)

Define a function:
   def functionName(params):
       [content]

Use Tyr..finally block:
   try:
      [Maybe throw exception code in there]
   finally:
      [Must do something]

Use 'with' keyword instead IO code:

     with [Maybe throw exception code in there] as [The return alias]:
          [Use the return alias to do something (Already contains alias.close())]

Use "print" function:
     print [content]
     print('[content]')

Use "for" block:
   1.iteration content
    for var_name in [array/string]:
        [Do something use content]
   2.iteration index
    for index in range([number]):
        [Do something use index]

Use "if" block:
   if [conditions]:
      [if content]
   elif [conditions]:
      [elif content]
   else:
      [else content]
